Data Analysis Project
Overview:
This project focuses on end-to-end data analysis using Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, and Power BI. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from raw data by performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, and building an interactive dashboard.
The project demonstrates strong analytical thinking, data preprocessing skills, and the ability to communicate insights effectively through reports and presentations.

Dataset:
1.The dataset contains structured data related to business/customer transactions.
2.Format: CSV
3.Size: Medium-scale dataset suitable for analysis and visualization.
4.The dataset includes numerical and categorical features used for trend analysis, customer behavior insights, and business metrics.

Tools & Technologies Used:
1.Python
2.pandas
3.numpy
4.PostgreSQL
5.SQL
6.Power BI
7.Jupyter Notebook
8.Gama (for PPT creation)

Project Workflow / Steps:
1.Data Loading:
Loaded CSV dataset using pandas in Jupyter Notebook.
Checked dataset structure, data types, and null values.

2.Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values.
Removed duplicates.
Converted categorical values where required.
Standardized column formats.
Treated outliers where necessary.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Univariate and bivariate analysis.
Statistical summaries.
Correlation analysis.
Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.
Identified trends, patterns, and anomalies.

4.SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL):
Connected Python to PostgreSQL.
Loaded cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL.
Performed SQL queries:
Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
GROUP BY analysis
Filtering using WHERE
Joins (if applicable)
Business KPI calculations

5.Power BI Dashboard:
Imported dataset into Power BI.
Built interactive dashboard with:
KPI cards
Bar charts
Line charts
Pie charts
Filters & slicers
Designed dashboard to provide business insights at a glance.

6️.Report & Presentation:
Created a structured data analysis report.
Summarized key findings and recommendations.
Developed a professional PowerPoint presentation using Gama.
Presented business insights visually and clearly.

Dashboard Features:
Revenue / Sales Overview
Category-wise performance
Trend analysis over time
Customer segmentation insights
KPI metrics for quick decision-making
The dashboard enables business stakeholders to make data-driven decisions efficiently.

Key Results & Insights:
Identified top-performing categories and segments.
Discovered customer behavior trends.
Highlighted revenue patterns and seasonal variations.
Provided actionable recommendations based on analysis.
Improved data quality through structured cleaning process.
